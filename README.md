# Psychic-Game
Guess the letter the computer picked randomly. You have 9 attempts.

# How the game works:
Game starts when user presses a letter (case insensitive)
Computer picks a random letter of the alphabet.
User has 9 guesses.
Guessing the same letter does not count as a new guess.
After 9 guesses, the user looses and the game restarts.
After the right guess, the wins increase by one and the game restarts.
